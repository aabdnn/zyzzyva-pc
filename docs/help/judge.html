  <h1>Judging and Defining Words</h1>

  <p>The Judge tab can be used to determine whether a word is acceptable, and
  the word's definition if it is acceptable.</p>

  <h2>Judging a Word</h2>

  <p>Judging a word can be useful if you only want to know whether a word is
  acceptable, and don't want to know its definition.  For example, in the
  middle of playing a word game, knowing a word's definition may change the
  way the word is treated by the players.  A player who might not otherwise
  have tried to add an S to the end of a word may feel comfortable doing so
  after learning that the word is a noun or verb.</p>

  <p>To Judge a word, go to the Judge tab.  Type the word to be judged into
  the input line.  Then click the Judge button.  The word will be displayed,
  along with the word "Acceptable" or "Unacceptable".</p>

  <h2>Defining a Word</h2>

  <p>The Judge tab can be used for defining a word as well as judging it.
  Knowing a word's definition can be useful when studying, as it can make the
  word and its inflections easier to remember.  To see a word's definition,
  type the word into the input line.  Then click the Define button, or press
  the Enter key.  The word will be displayed, along with the word "Acceptable"
  or "Unacceptable" and the word's definition.  If the word is acceptable but
  has no definition available, the phrase "(no definition)" will be
  displayed.</p>
