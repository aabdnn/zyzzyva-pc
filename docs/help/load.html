  <h1>Loading a Word List</h1>

  <p>In order for Zyzzyva to function properly, it must have a word list
  loaded.  Load a word list by choosing the <tt>File</tt> menu item, then
  <tt>Open</tt>.  Choose the word list file using the file browser that
  appears.</p>

  <p>The word list file should contain a list of valid words, one per line.
  Each word can also be followed by a definition, separated from the word by
  one or more spaces.  Here is an example of what a word list file might look
  like:</p>

  <pre>
AA rough, cindery lava
AB abdominal muscle
AD advertisement
  </pre>

  <p>Instead of loading a word list manually each time you use Zyzzyva, you
  can configure Zyzzyva to load a word list automatically each time it starts.
  See <a href="preferences.html#auto-import">Auto Import</a> for more
  details.</p>
