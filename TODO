Stuff that would be nice:

* Allow timers for quiz questions.  Allow different types of timers: total
  time per question; total time per correct answer; time per answer.

* Save size of Analyze dialog across sessions.  Also don't always make it
  fixed at the minimum size in both directions.  Maybe just horizontally.

* Allow Show Hooks function by right clicking on any list.

* Configure docs/help/zyzzyva.dcf at compile time with the correct
  QtAssistantClient version.

* Allow the user to edit word definitions from within Zyzzyva.

* Allow a quiz like "Find the shortest word containing these letters".
  Kind of like the License Plate game.

* Allow quizzes based on the disjunction of multiple searches.  For example,
  allow a quiz based on the top X bingo stems (TISANE?, SATIRE?, RETAIN?,
  etc).

* Allow quizzes based on a random rack of letters, drawn as if out of a real
  bag of Scrabble tiles.

* Allow quiz questions whose correct answer is "no words at all".

* Allow quizzes to end after X questions rather than running through all
  possible questions.

* Allow quizzes of hook letters.

* Keep permanent track of high scores on quizzes, words that need to be
  studied, invalid words that need to be forgotten.

* Allow taking back of accidental typos while taking a quiz.

* Allow unloading of a word list.

* Allow export of search results.

* Allow export of lists from the Analyze dialog.
