New Quiz Types:
---------------
- Hooks: 2-to
- Random racks:
- Find the shortest word containing these letters
- Top X bingo stems
- Mnemonic phrases: X-to-make-X+1 (ENTIRE + "IN GREAT CHUNKS"), Front Hook
  ("KNIGHT SWAM" + AE), Back Hook (KA + "BETSYS FEET")
- Include letter combinations that meet the search criteria but for which
  there is no valid quiz response (RETAIN + O = AEINORT).

New Search Criteria:
--------------------
- Probability
- Top X bingo stems

Major Features:
---------------
* Add a Game tab with a crossword game board that the user can manipulate.
  Eventually add a game engine that can find legal moves, etc.

Visual Polish:
--------------
* Add a title bar icon other than the default (the X logo under Linux and the
  Command Prompt icon under Windows).

* New font preferences: Input areas.  Quiz canvas.  Figure out how to change
  the font in the quiz canvas based on the user's font settings.

Usability:
----------
* Change Search form.  Instead of displaying a million options at once,
  display a dropdown with the various options in a list, e.g. "Matches
  Pattern", "Matches Anagram", "Min Length", etc.  Also add a button to allow
  the addition of more than one condition.  The search then consists of the
  conjunction of all the specified conditions.  Maybe some true Boolean logic
  could be added, but simple conjunction may be good enough for now.

* Add an overall timer for the taking of quizzes, even if a cutoff timer is
  not to be used for each question.  Keep track of total quiz time, and
  display it in the Analyze dialog.  Also save best times across sessions.

* Allow the user to edit word definitions from within Zyzzyva.

* Allow quizzes to end after X questions rather than running through all
  possible questions.

* Keep permanent track of high scores on quizzes, words that need to be
  studied, invalid words that need to be forgotten.

Word List Right Click Menus:
----------------------------
* Allow sorting of a word list via a right-click menu rather than an
  application-wide preference setting.

* Allow export of words from any word list.

* Allow saving of word lists to a PDF file or equivalent.  Also in format for
  offline quizzing using physical paper or index cards.

* Keep track of polyorths and allow them to be displayed.
