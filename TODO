Stuff that would be nice:

* Bug fix: Figure out how to change the font in the quiz canvas based on the
  user's font settings.  And then do it!

* New font preference: Input areas.

* Disallow quiz responses that do not correspond to the quiz question.  For
  example, if the question is anagram of EKTY, disallow "KITE" because it
  isn't even a proper anagram of those letters.

* Allow keyboard switching between tabs.  Ctrl-PgUp or something similar.

* Pop up New Quiz dialog when New Quiz is chosen from the main menu, instead
  of continuing to require the user to click the New Quiz button in the quiz
  form.  Get rid of the New Quiz button entirely.

* Keep track of polyorths and allow them to be displayed.

* Save size of Analyze dialog across sessions.  Also don't always make it
  fixed at the minimum size in both directions.  Maybe just horizontally.

* Add a toolbar for easily creating quizzes, searches, etc.

* Add an overall timer for the taking of quizzes, even if a cutoff timer is
  not to be used for each question.  Keep track of total quiz time, and
  display it in the Analyze dialog.  Also save best times across sessions.

* Add a title bar icon other than the default (the X logo under Linux and the
  Command Prompt icon under Windows).

* Allow right-clicking on any word, anywhere.  Pop up menu should include Show
  Definition, Show Hooks, etc.

* Configure docs/help/zyzzyva.dcf at compile time with the correct
  QtAssistantClient version.

* Allow the user to edit word definitions from within Zyzzyva.

* Allow a quiz like "Find the shortest word containing these letters".
  Kind of like the License Plate game.

* Allow quizzes based on the disjunction of multiple searches.  For example,
  allow a quiz based on the top X bingo stems (TISANE?, SATIRE?, RETAIN?,
  etc).

* Allow quizzes based on a random rack of letters, drawn as if out of a real
  bag of crossword-game tiles.

* Allow quiz questions whose correct answer is "no words at all".

* Allow quizzes to end after X questions rather than running through all
  possible questions.

* Allow quizzes of hook letters.

* Keep permanent track of high scores on quizzes, words that need to be
  studied, invalid words that need to be forgotten.

* Allow taking back of accidental typos while taking a quiz.

* Allow unloading of a word list.

* Allow export of search results.

* Allow export of lists from the Analyze dialog.
