Bug Fixes:
----------
* What the heck is ASSERT: i <= nodes in
  /home/mthelen/usr/lib/qt3.3.3-gcc3.4.1-thread/include/qvaluelist.h (372)

New Quiz Types:
---------------
- Hooks: 2-to
- Random racks:
- Find the shortest word containing these letters
- Top X bingo stems
- Mnemonic phrases: X-to-make-X+1 (ENTIRE + "IN GREAT CHUNKS"), Front Hook
  ("KNIGHT SWAM" + AE), Back Hook (KA + "BETSYS FEET")
- Include letter combinations that meet the search criteria but for which
  there is no valid quiz response (RETAIN + O = AEINORT).

New Search Criteria:
--------------------
- Num Anagrams
- Probability
- Top X bingo stems
- Is a Hook Word (makes valid word without first or last letter)

Major Features:
---------------
* Add a Game tab with a crossword game board that the user can manipulate.
  Eventually add a game engine that can find legal moves, etc.

Build System:
-------------
* Configure docs/help/zyzzyva.dcf at compile time with the correct
  QtAssistantClient version.

Visual Polish:
--------------
* Add a title bar icon other than the default (the X logo under Linux and the
  Command Prompt icon under Windows).

* New font preferences: Input areas.  Quiz canvas.  Figure out how to change
  the font in the quiz canvas based on the user's font settings.

Usability:
----------
* Disallow quiz responses that do not correspond to the quiz question.  For
  example, if the question is anagram of EKTY, disallow "KITE" because it
  isn't even a proper anagram of those letters.

* Allow word lists to show hooks automatically (three columns).

* Allow keyboard switching between tabs.  Ctrl-PgUp or something similar.

* Add a toolbar for easily creating quizzes, searches, etc.

* Allow unloading of a word list.

* Save size of Analyze dialog across sessions.  Also don't always make it
  fixed at the minimum size in both directions.  Maybe just horizontally.

* Add an overall timer for the taking of quizzes, even if a cutoff timer is
  not to be used for each question.  Keep track of total quiz time, and
  display it in the Analyze dialog.  Also save best times across sessions.

* Allow right-clicking on any word, anywhere.  Pop up menu should include Show
  Definition, Show Hooks, etc.

* Allow saving of named quizzes and searches.  Use this functionality to
  include predefined quizzes and searches.

* Allow the user to edit word definitions from within Zyzzyva.

* Allow quizzes to end after X questions rather than running through all
  possible questions.

* Keep permanent track of high scores on quizzes, words that need to be
  studied, invalid words that need to be forgotten.

Word List Right Click Menus:
----------------------------
* Allow sorting of a word list via a right-click menu rather than an
  application-wide preference setting.

* Show Anagrams.
* Show Subanagrams.
* Show Anagram Hooks.
* Show Anagrams with one letter changed (Blanagrams).
* Show Pattern Matches with one letter changed.
* Show Extensions.

* Allow export of words from any word list.

* Allow saving of word lists to a PDF file or equivalent.  Also in format for
  offline quizzing using physical paper or index cards.

* Keep track of polyorths and allow them to be displayed.
