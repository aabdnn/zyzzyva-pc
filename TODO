Stuff that would be nice:

* Bug?  What the heck is ASSERT: i <= nodes in
  /home/mthelen/usr/lib/qt3.3.3-gcc3.4.1-thread/include/qvaluelist.h (372)

* Disallow quiz responses that do not correspond to the quiz question.  For
  example, if the question is anagram of EKTY, disallow "KITE" because it
  isn't even a proper anagram of those letters.

* Allow keyboard switching between tabs.  Ctrl-PgUp or something similar.

* Allow sorting of a word list via a right-click menu rather than an
  application-wide preference setting.

* Keep track of polyorths and allow them to be displayed.

* Save size of Analyze dialog across sessions.  Also don't always make it
  fixed at the minimum size in both directions.  Maybe just horizontally.

* Add a toolbar for easily creating quizzes, searches, etc.

* Add an overall timer for the taking of quizzes, even if a cutoff timer is
  not to be used for each question.  Keep track of total quiz time, and
  display it in the Analyze dialog.  Also save best times across sessions.

* Add a title bar icon other than the default (the X logo under Linux and the
  Command Prompt icon under Windows).

* Allow right-clicking on any word, anywhere.  Pop up menu should include Show
  Definition, Show Hooks, etc.

* New font preferences: Input areas.  Quiz canvas.  Figure out how to change
  the font in the quiz canvas based on the user's font settings.

* Allow saving of word lists to a PDF file or equivalent.  Also in format for
  offline quizzing using physical paper or index cards.

* Configure docs/help/zyzzyva.dcf at compile time with the correct
  QtAssistantClient version.

* Allow the user to edit word definitions from within Zyzzyva.

* Allow quizzes on mnemonic phrases.  X-to-make-X+1, Front Hook, Back Hook.

* Allow a quiz like "Find the shortest word containing these letters".
  Kind of like the License Plate game.

* Allow quizzes based on the disjunction of multiple searches.  For example,
  allow a quiz based on the top X bingo stems (TISANE?, SATIRE?, RETAIN?,
  etc).

* Allow quizzes based on a random rack of letters, drawn as if out of a real
  bag of crossword-game tiles.

* Allow quiz questions whose correct answer is "no words at all".

* Allow quizzes to end after X questions rather than running through all
  possible questions.

* Allow quizzes of hook letters.

* Keep permanent track of high scores on quizzes, words that need to be
  studied, invalid words that need to be forgotten.

* Allow taking back of accidental typos while taking a quiz.

* Allow unloading of a word list.

* Allow export of search results.

* Allow export of lists from the Analyze dialog.
