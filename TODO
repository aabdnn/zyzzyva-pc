Stuff that would be nice:

* Add some online Help.

* Allow lists to be sorted alphabetically or by word length.

* Allow definitions of words both through a Define function and through
  right-clicking.

* Allow the user to edit word definitions from within Zyzzyva.

* Allow search results to use lower-case letters for letters matched by a
  blank or wildcard.

* Allow a quiz like "Find the shortest word containing these letters".
  Kind of like the License Plate game.

* Allow quizzes based on the disjunction of multiple searches.  For example,
  allow a quiz based on the top X bingo stems (TISANE?, SATIRE?, RETAIN?,
  etc).

* Allow quizzes based on a random rack of letters, drawn as if out of a real
  bag of Scrabble tiles.

* Allow quiz questions whose correct answer is "no words at all".

* Allow quizzes to end after X questions rather than running through all
  possible questions.

* Keep permanent track of high scores on quizzes, words that need to be
  studied, invalid words that need to be forgotten.

* Allow taking back of accidental typos while taking a quiz.
