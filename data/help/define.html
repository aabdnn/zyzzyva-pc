  <h1>Defining Words</h1>

  <p>Choose <tt>File-&gt;New Definition</tt> from the main menu to
  create a new Define tab.
  A Define tab can be used to show a word's definition.  Knowing a word's
  definition can be useful when studying, as it can make the word and its
  inflections easier to remember.  To see a word's definition, type the word
  into the input line.  Then click the Define button, or press the Enter key.
  The word will be displayed, along with the word "Acceptable" or
  "Unacceptable" and the word's definition.  If the word is acceptable but has
  no definition available, the phrase "(no definition)" will be displayed.</p>
