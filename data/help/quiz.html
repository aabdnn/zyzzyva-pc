  <h2>Creating a Quiz</h2>

  <p>A quiz creation window will appear when creating a new Quiz tab, clicking
  the <i>New Quiz</i> button on an existing Quiz tab, or right-clicking on a
  word list and selecting <i>Quiz from list</i>.  The quiz creation window
  includes a search definition area that is exactly the same as the one on the
  Search tab.  Please see <a href="search.html">Searching for Words</a> for
  more details about creating a search.  The specified search will select a
  list of words to be used in quiz questions.</p>

  <p>Once the list of words is determined, there are various ways they might
  be presented as quiz questions.  These options are known as Quiz Types.</p>

  <p><b>Anagram Quiz:</b> In the Anagram quiz type, each unique combination of
  letters is used as a quiz question, with each question requiring anagrams as
  an answer.  Each unique combination of letters will be presented with the
  letters in order as specified in the <a
  href="preferences.html#question-display">Quiz Question Display</a>
  preferences.</p>

  <p>The Anagram quiz type is most useful for improving one's anagramming
  skills, since each question will be a jumble of letters to be unscrambled.
  For example, with an <i>Anagram Match</i> condition of <tt>SATIRE?</tt>, the
  quiz questions will consist of <tt>AAEIRST</tt>, <tt>ABEIRST</tt>,
  <tt>ACEIRST</tt>, etc.  With the randomize option checked, the questions
  will appear in random order.</p>

  <p><b>Word List Recall:</b> In the Word List Recall quiz type, the quiz has
  just one question, requiring the full list of words as an answer.  This quiz
  type is useful when trying to recall a specific list of words from memory,
  such as the list of all three-letter words.</p>

  <p><b>Hook Quiz:</b> In the Hook quiz type, each word is used as a quiz
  question, with each question requiring hooks as an answer (all words that
  can be formed by adding a single letter to the front or back of the
  word).</p>

  <p>The <i>Restore progress</i> checkbox is used when loading previously
  saved quizzes.  See <a href="quiz.html#load-save-quiz">Loading and Saving
  Quizzes</a> for more details.</p>

  <p>If the <i>Randomize order</i> checkbox is activated, the quiz
  questions will be presented in random order.  If the checkbox is not
  activated, the questions will be presented in alphabetical order.</p>

  <p>A timer can also be configured for any quiz type to add extra challenge
  to the quiz.  Activating the <i>Timer</i> checkbox will allow you to specify
  a time limit on a <i>per response</i> or <i>per question</i> basis.  If the
  <i>per response</i> timer is chosen, you will have the specified amount of
  time to enter each individual response to a question.  The timer will reset
  itself each time a response is entered.  If the <i>per question</i> timer is
  chosen, you will have the specified amount of time to enter <i>all</i>
  responses to a question.  The timer will not reset itself after each
  response is entered.</p>

  <p>When the quiz has been specified, click the <i>OK</i> button in the quiz
  creation window to begin taking the quiz.</p>

  <a name="take-quiz">
  <h2>Taking a Quiz</h2>

  <p>Each quiz question requires a list of words as an answer.  Enter each
  word by typing the word in the input box near the bottom of the Quiz tab and
  pressing Enter.  If the word is a valid response, it will appear above the
  input box with the word "Correct", and it will also be added to the response
  list.  If the word is not a valid response, it will appear above the input
  box with the word "Incorrect".</p>

  <p>Once all the response words have been entered, click the <i>Check
  Answers</i> button or press Enter in the empty input box.  This will submit
  the current word list as the final response to the quiz question.  If any
  valid responses were missed, they will appear in the word list with a green
  background color.  The number of correct words entered and the total number
  of valid responses will also be displayed above the input box.  For example,
  if the quiz question is <tt>ACEIRST</tt> and the valid responses
  <tt>RACIEST</tt> and <tt>STEARIC</tt> were entered, then the forgotten word
  <tt>CRISTAE</tt> will appear in the response list, and the message "Correct:
  2 of 3" will appear above the input box.</p>

  <p>After clicking the <i>Check Answers</i> button and reviewing the judgment
  of your response, click the <i>Next</i> button to continue to the next quiz
  question.</p>

  <p>If the quiz is using a timer, the timer can be paused at any time by
  clicking the <i>Pause</i> button.  Unpause the timer by clicking the
  <i>Unpause</i> button.  If the timer runs down to zero, the correct
  responses will be displayed automatically, as if the <i>Check Answers</i>
  button were clicked.</p>

  <a name="analyze-quiz">
  <h2>Analyzing Your Quiz Performance</h2>

  <p>At any time while taking a quiz or after a quiz is completed, you can
  analyze your performance by clicking the <i>Analyze Quiz</i> button.  A quiz
  analysis window will appear.  At the top of the window is a summary of the
  current quiz, along with some statistics about your performance so far.</p>

  <p>Performance statistics are presented as Recall and Precision.  Recall
  represents the number of correct response words that were actually given as
  responses.  For example, if there were a total of 60 valid response words
  throughout the course of a quiz, and you correctly identified 45 of them,
  your Recall performance is 45/60, or 75%.  Precision represents the number
  of response words you provided that were actually correct.  For example, if
  you provided 50 responses and 45 of them were correct, your Precision
  performance is 45/50, or 90%.  The numerator of both Recall and Precision
  will always be the same, since in both cases it represents the number of
  correct responses you have given over the course of the quiz.</p>

  <p>The quiz analysis window also provides a list of Missed words and a list
  of Incorrect words.  The Missed list contains the valid response words that
  were not provided by the quiz participant.  This list generally consists of
  words you may need to study a bit more.  The Incorrect list contains the
  incorrect responses provided by the quiz participant.  This list generally
  consists of invalid words you should try to forget.</p>

  <p>When you are done analyzing your quiz performance, click the <i>Close</i>
  button to close the quiz analysis window.</p>

  <a name="load-save-quiz">
  <h2>Loading and Saving Quizzes</h2>

  <p>Some quizzes are too long to be completed in a single session.  For
  this reason, Zyzzyva allows you to save your progress in the middle of a
  quiz, and resume the quiz later where you left off.  When taking a quiz, you
  can click the <i>Save Quiz</i> button at any time to save your progress.  A
  window will appear to allow you to save the quiz to a file.</p>

  <p>Later, if you want to resume the quiz, choose <tt>File-&gt;Quiz</tt> from
  the main menu, and click the <i>Load Quiz</i> button within the New Quiz
  window.  A window will appear to allow you to select the saved quiz file.
  After choosing the file, the saved quiz will appear in the quiz
  specification area.  By default after loading a quiz, the <i>Restore
  progress</i> checkbox will be activated.  To start the quiz from the
  beginning instead of resuming where it was left off, deactivate the
  <i>Restore progress</i> checkbox.  The checkbox will also become disabled if
  the quiz specification is modified after loading it.  After clicking
  <i>OK</i>, the quiz will begin.</p>
