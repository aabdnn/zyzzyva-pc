  <h2>Creating a Quiz</h2>

  <p>A quiz creation window will appear when creating a new Quiz tab, or
  when the New Quiz button is clicked on an existing Quiz tab.  The quiz
  creation window includes a search definition area that is exactly the same
  as the one on the Search tab.  Please see <a href="search.html">Searching
  for Words</a> for more details about creating a search.</p>

  <p>The specified search will select a list of words to be used in quiz
  questions.  Once the list of words is determined, there are two ways they
  might be presented as quiz questions.  The first option is for the quiz to
  have just one question, requiring the full list of words as an answer.  This
  option is useful when trying to recall a specific list of words from memory,
  such as the 972 three-letter words.</p>

  <p>The second option is for each unique combination of letters to be used as
  quiz questions, with each question requiring anagrams as an answer.  Each
  unique combination of letters will be presented with the letters in
  alphabetical order (as an "alphagram").  This option is specified by
  activating the <i>Use individual alphagrams as questions</i> checkbox.  If
  the <i>Randomize order</i> checkbox is also activated, the quiz questions
  will be presented in random order.</p>

  <p>The alphagram option is most useful for improving one's anagramming
  skills, since each question will be a jumble of letters to be unscrambled.
  For example, with an <i>Anagram</i> search of <tt>SATIRE?</tt> and the
  alphagram option checked, the quiz questions will consist of
  <tt>AAEIRST</tt>, <tt>ABEIRST</tt>, <tt>ACEIRST</tt>, etc.  With the
  randomize option checked, the questions will appear in random order.</p>

  <p>When the quiz has been specified, click the <i>OK</i> button in the quiz
  creation window to begin taking the quiz.</p>

  <a name="take-quiz">
  <h2>Taking a Quiz</h2>

  <p>Each quiz question requires a list of words as an answer.  If the quiz
  question is an alphagram, the correct answer to the question will be the
  list of words containing all the letters in the alphagram.  If the quiz
  question is a search specification, the correct answer will be the list of
  words matching the specification.</p>

  <p>Enter each word by typing the word in the input box near the bottom of
  the Quiz tab and pressing Enter.  If the word is a valid response, it will
  appear above the input box with the word "Correct", and it will also be
  added to the response list.  If the word is not a valid response, it will
  appear above the input box with the word "Incorrect".</p>

  <p>Once all the response words have been entered, click the <i>Check</i>
  button or press Enter in the empty input box.  This will submit the current
  word list as the final response to the quiz question.  If any valid
  responses were missed, they will appear in the word list in a magenta
  color.  The number of correct words entered and the total number of valid
  responses will also be displayed above the input box.  For example, if the
  quiz question is <tt>ACEIRST</tt> and the valid responses <tt>RACIEST</tt>
  and <tt>STEARIC</tt> were entered, then the forgotten word <tt>CRISTAE</tt>
  will appear in the response list, and the message "Correct: 2 of 3" will
  appear above the input box.</p>

  <p>After clicking the <i>Check</i> button and reviewing the judgment of your
  response, click the <i>Next</i> button to continue to the next quiz
  question.</p>

  <h2>Analyzing Your Quiz Performance</h2>

  <p>At any time while taking a quiz or after a quiz is completed, you can
  analyze your performance by clicking the <i>Analyze</i> button.  A quiz
  analysis window will appear.  At the top of the window is a summary of the
  current quiz, along with some statistics about your performance so far.</p>

  <p>Performance statistics are presented as Recall and Precision.  Recall
  represents the number of correct response words that were actually given as
  responses.  For example, if there were a total of 60 valid response words
  throughout the course of a quiz, and you correctly identified 45 of them,
  your Recall performance is 45/60, or 75%.  Precision represents the number
  of response words you provided that were actually correct.  For example, if
  you provided 50 responses and 45 of them were correct, your Precision
  performance is 45/50, or 90%.  The numerator of both Recall and Precision
  will always be the same, since in both cases it represents the number of
  correct responses you have given over the course of the quiz.</p>

  <p>The quiz analysis window also provides a list of Missed words and a list
  of Incorrect words.  The Missed list contains the valid response words that
  were not provided by the quiz participant.  This list generally consists of
  words you may need to study a bit more.  The Incorrect list contains the
  incorrect responses provided by the quiz participant.  This list generally
  consists of invalid words you should try to forget.</p>

  <p>When you are done analyzing your quiz performance, click the <i>Close</i>
  button to close the quiz analysis window.</p>
