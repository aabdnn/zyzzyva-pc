  <h1>Preferences</h1>

  <p>Preferences can be configured by choosing <tt>Edit-&gt;Preferences</tt>
  from the main menu.</p>

  <a name="auto-import">
  <h2>Auto Import</h2>

  <p>Zyzzyva can be configured to import a word list automatically each time
  it starts.  To do so, select the <tt>Automatically import a word list on
  startup</tt> option.  Click the <tt>Browse</tt> button to bring up a file
  browser, from which you can choose the word list file to be loaded.</p>

  <a name="tile-theme">
  <h2>Tile Theme</h2>

  <p>Questions in Quiz mode can be displayed using the configured font, or
  using an image for each letter.  The set of images representing each letter
  is collectively known as a tile theme.  To enable tile themes, select the
  <tt>Use tile images in Quiz mode</tt> option.  The dropdown box with
  available themes will become enabled, and a tile theme can then be selected.
  Once a tile theme is selected, quiz questions will be displayed using the
  chosen tile theme.</p>

  <p>Zyzzyva comes with several tile themes by default.  A new tile theme can
  be added by putting images in a new subdirectory under the
  <tt>data/tiles</tt> directory relative to Zyzzyva.  A tile theme consists of
  26 images named A.png through Z.png, and a 27th image named _.png
  (representing a blank tile).</p>

  <a name="font">
  <h2>Font Settings</h2>

  <p>The fonts used by Zyzzyva can be configured in the Font selection area.
  Fonts can be configured individually for the following items:</p>

  <ul>
  <li><b>Main:</b> The main application font, used for all displayed text not
  falling into one of the categories listed below.</li>
  <li><b>Word lists:</b> Lists of words that are displayed, e.g. the
  results of a search or the correct answers to a quiz question.</li>
  <li><b>Word input:</b> Input areas where words are to be entered, e.g. the
  input lines of the Search tab or the input area of the Judge tab.</li>
  <li><b>Definitions:</b> Areas where word definitions are displayed, e.g. the
  Define and Judge tabs.  Also, various other places where words are displayed
  outside a word list.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>To configure the fonts used by Zyzzyva, click the <tt>Choose</tt> button
  to the right of the item whose font you wish to change.  A font browser will
  appear, from which you can choose the font to be used.</p>

  <a name="word-lists">
  <h2>Word Lists</h2>

  <p>The following settings apply to all word lists displayed in Zyzzyva.
  Changing one of these settings will affect that setting for all word
  lists.</p>

  <a name="sort-by-length">
  <h3>Sort by word length</h3>

  <p>Often it is useful to see word lists sorted by word length, rather than
  alphabetically.  If the <tt>Sort by word length</tt> option is selected,
  word lists in Zyzzyva will be sorted by word length.  Within groups of words
  of equal length, the words will continue to be sorted alphabetically.</p>

  <a name="show-hooks">
  <h3>Show hooks</h3>

  <p>If the <tt>Show hooks</tt> option is selected, Zyzzyva will automatically
  display hooks for words in all word lists.  Front hooks (letters that can be
  added at the beginning of a word to make another valid word) are displayed
  in a column to the left of the word.  Back hooks (letters that can be added
  at the end of a word to make another valid word) are displayed in a column
  to the right of the word.</p>

  <p>Having hooks automatically displayed can be extremely helpful for
  learning new words, since it requires no manual effort to display hooks.
  With hooks automatically displayed, each item in a word list is capable of
  displaying many words simultaneously, instead of just a single word.  Be
  aware, however, that selecting this option can make searches run more slowly
  in the Search tab, especially if the search returns a large number of result
  words.</p>

  <a name="show-inner-hooks">
  <h3>Show inner hooks</h3>

  <p>If the <tt>Show inner hooks</tt> option is selected, Zyzzyva will
  automatically display inner hooks for words in all word lists.  An inner
  hook is a valid word that can be formed by removing the first or last letter
  of a word.  For example, the word BOWLS has two inner hooks.  The word OWLS
  can be formed by removing the initial B, and the word BOWL can be formed by
  removing the trailing S.  When this option is selected, a <tt>-</tt>
  character will be displayed at the front of words whose first letters can be
  removed to form valid words, and at the back of words whose last letters can
  be removed.</p>

  <a name="show-definitions">
  <h3>Show definitions</h3>

  <p>If the <tt>Show definitions</tt> option is selected, Zyzzyva will
  automatically display definitions for words in all word lists.  A word's
  definition will appear in a separate column to the right of the word.</p>

  <a name="save-preferences">
  <h2>Saving Changes to Preferences</h2>

  <p>When you are done configuring your preferences, click the <tt>OK</tt>
  button to close the Preferences window.  Any changes to the font settings
  will take effect immediately.  Most changes to word list settings will take
  effect immediately, but the <tt>Sort by word length</tt> setting may not
  take effect for a word list until the list's contents are changed.</p>
