  <h1>Preferences</h1>

  <p>Preferences can be configured by choosing the <tt>Edit</tt> menu item,
  then <tt>Preferences</tt>.</p>

  <a name="auto-import">
  <h2>Auto Import</h2>

  <p>Zyzzyva can be configured to import a word list automatically each time
  it starts.  To do so, select the <tt>Automatically import a word list on
  startup</tt> option.  Click the <tt>Browse</tt> button to bring up a file
  browser, from which you can choose the word list file to be loaded.</p>

  <a name="tile-theme">
  <h2>Tile Theme</h2>

  <p>Questions in Quiz mode can be displayed using the configured font, or
  using an image for each letter.  The set of images representing each letter
  is collectively known as a tile theme.  To enable tile themes, select the
  <tt>Use tile images in Quiz mode</tt> option.  The dropdown box with
  available themes will become enabled, and a tile theme can then be selected.
  Once a tile theme is selected, quiz questions will be displayed using the
  chosen tile theme.</p>

  <p>Zyzzyva comes with several tile themes by default.  A new tile theme can
  be added by putting images in a new subdirectory under the
  <tt>data/tiles</tt> directory relative to Zyzzyva.  A tile theme consists of
  26 images named A.png through Z.png, and a 27th image named _.png
  (representing a blank tile).</p>

  <a name="font">
  <h2>Font Settings</h2>

  <p>To configure the font used by Zyzzyva, click the <tt>Choose</tt> button at
  the right of the Font selection area.  This will bring up a font browser,
  from which you can choose the font to be used.</p>

  <a name="miscellaneous">
  <h2>Miscellaneous</h2>

  <a name="sort-by-length">
  <h3>Sort word lists by length</h3>

  <p>Often it is useful to see word lists sorted by length, rather than
  alphabetically.  If the <tt>Sort word lists by length</tt> option is
  selected, word lists in Zyzzyva will be sorted by word length.  Within
  groups of words of equal length, the words will continue to be sorted
  alphabetically.</p>

  <p>When you are done configuring your preferences, click the <tt>OK</tt>
  button to close the Preferences window.  Any changes to the font setting
  will take effect immediately.</p>
