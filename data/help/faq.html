<a name="why-zyzzyva">
</a><p><a name="why-zyzzyva"><b>Why is the program called Zyzzyva?</b></a></p>

<p><a name="why-zyzzyva">I wanted to pick a fun word that was somewhat unique. I knew "zyzzyva" was
one of the most improbable words to be played in a SCRABBLE® game, and I
liked the sound of it. Later on, after I had picked the name, I realized that
since "zyzzyva" was also the last word in alphabetical order (it has since
been replaced by "zzz"), I could call Zyzzyva "the last word" in word study. I
wish I could say I was smart enough to come up with that slogan from the
start.</a></p>

<a name="why-free">
</a><p><a name="why-free"><b>Why is Zyzzyva available for free?</b></a></p>

<p><a name="why-free">I created Zyzzyva because I wanted a program for studying SCRABBLE®
words.  There are several programs available, but all of them either lack
features I wanted or do not run on Linux.  I therefore took it upon myself to
create the program I wanted, and Zyzzyva is the result.  I have made it
available under the GNU GPL because I feel that others should be able to
benefit freely from my work.</a></p>

<a name="when-handheld">
</a><p><a name="when-handheld"><b>When will there be a version of Zyzzyva for my handheld device?</b></a></p>

<p><a name="when-handheld">Zyzzyva is not available for any handheld devices yet.  However, I recently
acquired an iPod touch, and I hope to create a version of Zyzzyva that will
run on the iPod touch or iPhone. Because the existing Zyzzyva source code is
not able to be used directly on the iPhone, I don't know how long it will take
to produce such a program. When it's available, I will announce it on the </a><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/zyzzyva-users/">Zyzzyva Users</a> mailing
list.</p>

<a name="transfer-computers">
</a><p><a name="transfer-computers"><b>How can I transfer my Zyzzyva data from one computer to another?</b></a></p>

<p><a name="transfer-computers">You can transfer all your data to a new computer by copying your data
directory. You can find out where your Zyzzyva data directory is by opening
the Preferences window in Zyzzyva and looking at the Data Directory setting.
Make a copy of this directory, and move it to wherever you like, on the new
computer. Then, after you install Zyzzyva on the new computer, open the
Preferences window and change the Data Directory setting to point to wherever
you put your data directory from the original computer.</a></p>

<p><a name="transfer-computers">The transfer should work regardless of the operating systems used on the two
computers. For example, you should be able to transfer your data directory
from a Windows computer to a Mac, or vice versa.</a></p>

<a name="usb-data">
</a><p><a name="usb-data"><b>Can I keep my Zyzzyva data on a USB thumb drive?</b></a></p>

<p><a name="usb-data">Absolutely. This may be a good option for anyone wanting to use Zyzzyva on
multiple computers without having to copy data directories back and forth.
Simply copy your data directory onto the USB drive (using the process
described in </a><a href="#transfer-computers">How can I transfer my Zyzzyva data
from one computer to another?</a>). Then open the Preferences window and
change the Data Directory setting to point to the data directory on the USB
drive.</p>

<a name="print-word-list">
</a><p><a name="print-word-list"><b>How do I print a list of words?</b></a></p>

<p><a name="print-word-list">Unfortunately there's no print functionality built into Zyzzyva yet.  The
best you can do for right now is right-click (Control-click on a Mac) on any
word list (e.g. Search results) and save it in plain text format. Then
manipulate the list and print it from a text editor program, like Notepad or
Wordpad on Windows.</a></p>

<a name="cardbox">
</a><p><a name="cardbox"><b>How does the Cardbox system work?</b></a></p>

<p><a name="cardbox">The basic idea is that you must first tell Zyzzyva which words you'd like
it to keep track of. You generally do this by performing a search, then
right-clicking the search results and choosing "Add to Cardbox". Then Zyzzyva
keeps track of those words and automatically quizzes you on the ones it thinks
you need to see each day. When you miss a word frequently, Zyzzyva will show
it to you more often. A more detailed explanation is given in the </a><a href="http://svn.pietdepsi.com/repos/projects/zyzzyva/trunk/data/help/quiz.html#cardbox-quiz">Help
documentation</a>.</p>

<a name="inner-hooks">
</a><p><a name="inner-hooks"><b>When viewing search results, what are the '-' marks at the beginning or
end of certain words?</b></a></p>

<p><a name="inner-hooks">Those marks denote "inner hooks" - they mean that either the first or last
letter of the word can be dropped to form another valid word, depending on
where the hyphen appears. If the hyphen appears at the beginning of the word,
then the first letter can be dropped. If the hyphen appears at the end of the
word, then the last letter can be dropped.  A more detailed explanation is
given in the </a><a href="http://svn.pietdepsi.com/repos/projects/zyzzyva/trunk/data/help/preferences.html#show-inner-hooks">Help
documentation</a>.</p>

<a name="calculate-probability">
</a><p><a name="calculate-probability"><b>How does Zyzzyva calculate the probability of a word?</b></a></p>

<p><a name="calculate-probability">I don't have a nice formula handy, but it's basically a straight
calculation of the number of possible combinations to get a particular set of
letters from a full bag, including blanks. Separate combination values are
calculated for drawing zero, one, or two blanks, and then the numbers of
combinations are added together to get the total number of ways of drawing a
word. If you're interested, you can see the source code for yourself </a><a href="http://svn.pietdepsi.com/repos/projects/zyzzyva/trunk/src/libzyzzyva/LetterBag.cpp">here</a>
(see LetterBag::getNumCombinations particularly).

<a name="probability-intuition">
</a></p><p><a name="probability-intuition"><b>Are you sure the probability calculation is accurate? It seems
unintuitive to me.</b></a></p>

<p><a name="probability-intuition">Yep, it really is correct. The calculation of probability is notorious for
violating human intuition. One useful guideline to remember is that doubled or
tripled letters make a particular letter combination much more improbable than
you might think. That's because the number of ways to draw two identical
letters out of the bag is generally much lower than the number of ways to draw
two different letters out of the bag. If you'd like to verify the math, you
can see the source code for yourself </a><a href="http://svn.pietdepsi.com/repos/projects/zyzzyva/trunk/src/libzyzzyva/LetterBag.cpp">here</a>
(see LetterBag::getNumCombinations particularly).

<a name="all-marked-missed">
</a></p><p><a name="all-marked-missed"><b>Why did Zyzzyva mark all my answers as missed when I actually got them
all correct?</b></a></p>

<p><a name="all-marked-missed">Zyzzyva only marks all responses as missed if you actually entered all the
correct responses, but also provided an incorrect response. The reason for
marking all responses as missed is because (currently) Zyzzyva has no other
way of marking the question as missed without marking at least one response as
missed. So instead of picking a random response to mark as missed, it marks
them all.</a></p>

<p><a name="all-marked-missed">This only happens if you have the 'Mark question as missed after an
incorrect response' setting activated, but not 'End question after an
incorrect response'. Technically, it could also happen if you have the 'End
question after an incorrect response' setting activated, but not 'End question
after all correct responses', and the incorrect response is the last one you
give.</a></p>

<a name="donate">
</a><p><a name="donate"><b>I love Zyzzyva so much that I would like to send you giant piles of
money. How can I do that?</b></a></p>

amount. You can do so by visiting the </a><a href="http://zyzzyva.net/donate.shtml">Donate</a>
