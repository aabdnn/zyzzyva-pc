  <h1>Working with Word Lists</h1>

  <p>Most of the word lists displayed throughout Zyzzyva can be used in
  special ways by right-clicking on them.  Right-click anywhere on a word list
  to use these features.</p>

  <h2>Saving a Word List</h2>

  <p>To save the words in a list, right-click on the list and choose <i>Save
  list</i>.  A window will appear, allowing you to choose the name of the file
  and the place where you want to save it.  It is recommended that the saved
  file be named with a ".txt" ending.  The words in the list will be saved in
  the same order they appear in the list, with one word on each line.</p>

  <h2>Creating a Quiz from a Word List</h2>

  <p>To create a quiz from a word list, right-click on the list and choose
  <i>Quiz from list</i>.  This will cause a New Quiz window to appear, with an
  <i>In Word List</i> condition containing the words in the list.  To begin a
  quiz using the words in the list, simply click the <i>OK</i> button.
  For more details about how to create a quiz, see <a

  <p>Creating a quiz from a word list can be especially useful for quizzing
  yourself only on the words you missed in a previous quiz.  Since the words
  missed during a quiz are displayed in a word list titled <i>Missed</i> in
  the Analyze Quiz window, simply open the Analyze Quiz window, right-click on
  the <i>Missed</i> list, and choose <i>Quiz from list</i>.  A quiz will
  begin, using only the words that were missed in the previous quiz.  For more
  details about the Analyze Quiz window, see <a
  href="quiz.html#analyze-quiz">Analyzing Your Quiz Performance</a>.</p>
