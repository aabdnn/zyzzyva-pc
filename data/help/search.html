  <h1>Searching for Words</h1>

  <p>Choose <tt>File-&gt;New Search</tt> from the main menu to
  create a new Search tab.
  A Search tab can be used to find all acceptable words that match
  certain criteria.  The criteria are specified in the top part of the Search
  tab, and the resulting list of words is displayed in the bottom area.  Click
  the <i>Search</i> button to perform a search, and click the <i>Reset</i>
  button to reset the values in the search specification area.</p>

  <a name="match-types">
  <h2>Match Types</h2>

  <p>The main search criterion is a pattern of letters to be matched.  This is
  specified in the <i>Match</i> section.  A match can be specified as
  <i>Pattern</i>, <i>Anagram</i>, or <i>Subanagram</i>.</p>

  <a name="pattern-match">
  <h3>Pattern Match</h3>

  <p>The <i>Pattern</i> match type means that the search pattern must be
  matched exactly, in the same order the letters are specified.  Special
  wildcard characters can be used to match any letters: the <tt>?</tt>
  character means "match any single letter" and the <tt>*</tt> character means
  "match any number of letters".  The <tt>*</tt> character also matches
  nothingness.  Multiple wildcard characters can be used in a single pattern.
  Here are some examples of <i>Pattern</i> matches:</p>

  <table width="100%">
  <tr><td><b>Pattern</b></td><td><b>Matches</b></td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>ATE</tt></td><td><tt>ATE</tt></td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>AT?</tt></td><td><tt>ATE, ATT</tt></td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>AT??</tt></td><td><tt>ATAP, ATES, ATMA, ATOM,
  ATOP</tt></td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>T?P</tt></td><td><tt>TAP, TIP, TOP, TUP</tt></td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>TO*P</tt></td><td><tt>TOP, TOECAP, TOSSUP, TOUCHUP, TOYSHOP,
  TOWNSHIP</tt></td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>*WM</tt></td><td><tt>CWM, SHAWM</tt></td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>?W*M?S</tt></td><td><tt>SWAMIS, SWAMPS, TWASOMES, TWOSOMES,
  TWELVEMOS</tt></td></tr>
  </table>

  <a name="anagram-match">
  <h3>Anagram Match</h3>

  <p>The <i>Anagram</i> match type means that the letters in the search
  pattern can be matched in any order.  All the letters must be matched
  exactly the number of times they appear in the match pattern.  The same
  special wildcard characters can be used as described in the <a
  href="#pattern-match">Pattern Match</a> section.  Here are some examples of
  <i>Anagram</i> matches:</p>

  <table width="100%">
  <tr><td><b>Pattern</b></td><td><b>Matches</b></td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>ATE</tt></td><td><tt>ATE, EAT, ETA, TAE, TEA</tt></td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>AENORST</tt></td><td><tt>ATONERS, SENATOR, TREASON</tt></td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>ETX?</tt></td><td><tt>EXIT, NEXT, SEXT, TEXT, VEXT</tt></td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>PI??Z</tt></td><td><tt>PIZZA, PRIZE, SPITZ, UNZIP, ZIPPY</tt></td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>*JBX</tt></td><td><tt>JAMBEAUX</tt></td></tr>
  </table>

  <p>Note that with an <i>Anagram</i> match, using more than one <tt>*</tt>
  character has the same effect as using just one.</p>

  <a name="subanagram-match">
  <h3>Subanagram Match</h3>

  <p>The <i>Subanagram</i> match type means that the letters in the search
  pattern can be matched in any order, and not all letters must be used in
  each matching word.  The same special wildcard characters can be used as
  described in the <a href="#pattern-match">Pattern Match</a> section.  Here
  are some examples of <i>Subanagram</i> matches:</p>

  <table width="100%">
  <tr><td><b>Pattern</b></td><td><b>Matches</b></td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>ATE</tt></td><td><tt>AE, AT, ET, TA, ATE, EAT, ETA, TAE, TEA</tt></td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>LX?</tt></td><td><tt>AL, AX, EL, EX, LA, LI, LO, OX, XI, XU, LAX, LEX, LOX, LUX</tt></td></tr>
  </table>

  <p>Note that with an <i>Subanagram</i> match, using a <tt>*</tt>
  character will cause the pattern to match every acceptable word.</p>

  <a name="min-max-length">
  <h2>Minimum and Maximum Length</h2>

  <p>A minimum and maximum length can be specified for the results of a
  search.  To change these values, adjust the numbers in the <i>Min Length</i>
  and <i>Max Length</i> boxes.  For example, if the minimum length is 4 and
  the maximum length is 6, then the search will only return results that are
  between four and six letters long.  The minimum length cannot be greater
  than the maximum length.</p>

  <a name="include-exclude-letters">
  <h2>Including and Excluding Letters</h2>

  <p>The input box labeled <i>Must Include</i> specifies letters that must
  be included in each word in the search results.  This is most useful if you
  want to specify a <i>Pattern</i> match with wildcard characters, and want
  the wildcards to match certain letters in an unspecified order.</p>

  <p>For example, to find all 7- and 8-letter words beginning with
  <tt>OVER</tt> and containing the letters <tt>A</tt>, <tt>L</tt>, and
  <tt>T</tt> in any order, do the following.  Specify a <i>Pattern</i> match
  of <tt>OVER*</tt> with minimum length 7, maximum length 8, and <i>Must
  Include</i> <tt>ALT</tt>.  This search will find the words
  <tt>OVERLATE</tt>, <tt>OVERSALT</tt>, and <tt>OVERTALK</tt>.</p>

  <p>If a letter appears more than once in the <i>Must Include</i> box, the
  letter must appear at least that many times in each word in the search
  results.</p>

  <p>The input box labeled <i>Must Exclude</i> specifies letters that must
  not be included in the search results.  This is most useful for generating
  special word lists, such as the list of words containing the letter Q but
  not the letter U.  To find such words, specify a <i>Pattern</i> match of
  <tt>*</tt> with <i>Must Include</i> <tt>Q</tt> and <i>Must Exclude</i>
  <tt>U</tt>.  This search will find the 21 words containing Q but not U.</p>

  <a name="consist-letters">
  <h2>Letter Frequency</h2>

  <p>The area labeled <i>Must Consist of</i> specifies letters that must occur
  with a certain minimum frequency.  This is useful for generating special
  word lists, such as the list of words containing at least 70% vowels.  To
  find such words, set the value in the percentage box to <tt>70</tt>, and put
  <tt>AEIOU</tt> in the input box.</p>

  <a name="other-options">
  <h2>Other Options</h2>

  <p>If the <i>Use lower-case letters for wildcard matches</i> checkbox is
  activated, any letters matched by a wildcard character will appear in lower
  case in the search results.  For example, with this checkbox activated, an
  <i>Anagram</i> search of <tt>EXT?</tt> will result in <tt>EXiT</tt>,
  <tt>nEXT</tt>, <tt>sEXT</tt>, <tt>TEXt</tt>, <tt>vEXT</tt> rather than
  <tt>EXIT</tt>, <tt>NEXT</tt>, <tt>SEXT</tt>, <tt>TEXT</tt>,
  <tt>VEXT</tt>.</p>
