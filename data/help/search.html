  <h1>Searching for Words</h1>

  <p>Choose <tt>File-&gt;Search</tt> from the main menu to create a new Search
  tab.  A Search tab can be used to find all acceptable words that match
  certain conditions.  The conditions are specified in the top part of the
  Search tab, and the resulting list of words is displayed in the bottom area.
  Initially only a single search condition is displayed.  Add more conditions
  by clicking the <i>More</i> button.  Remove conditions from the bottom of
  the list by clicking the <i>Fewer</i> button.  When the search conditions
  are correct, click the <i>Search</i> button to perform a search.</p>

  <a name="search-conditions">
  <h2>Search Conditions</h2>

  <p>The available search conditions are described below.  Any number of each
  type of condition can be specified in a single search.</p>

  <a name="anagram-match">
  <h3>Anagram Match</h3>

  <p>The <i>Anagram Match</i> condition means that the letters in the search
  pattern can be matched in any order.  All the letters must be matched
  exactly the number of times they appear in the match pattern.  Special
  wildcard characters can be used to match any letters: the <tt>?</tt>
  character means "match any single letter" and the <tt>*</tt> character means
  "match any number of letters".  The <tt>*</tt> character also matches
  nothingness.  Multiple wildcard characters can be used in a single pattern.
  The <tt>[</tt> and <tt>]</tt> characters can also be used to specify a set
  of letters that can be matched.  Here are some examples of <i>Anagram
  Match</i> conditions:</p>

  <table width="100%">
  <tr><td><b>Pattern</b></td><td><b>Matches</b></td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>ATE</tt></td><td><tt>ATE, EAT, ETA, TAE, TEA</tt></td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>AENORST</tt></td><td><tt>ATONERS, SENATOR,
  TREASON</tt></td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>ETX?</tt></td><td><tt>EXIT, NEXT, SEXT, TEXT,
  VEXT</tt></td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>PI??Z</tt></td><td><tt>PIZZA, PRIZE, SPITZ, UNZIP,
  ZIPPY</tt></td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>Z[AEIOU][AEIOU]</tt></td><td><tt>AZO, ZEE, ZOA,
  ZOO</tt></td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>*JBX</tt></td><td><tt>JAMBEAUX</tt></td></tr>
  </table>

  <p>Note that with an <i>Anagram Match</i> condition, using more than one
  <tt>*</tt> character has the same effect as using just one.</p>

  <a name="pattern-match">
  <h3>Pattern Match</h3>

  <p>The <i>Pattern Match</i> condition means that the search pattern must be
  matched exactly, in the same order the letters are specified.  The same
  special wildcard characters can be used as described in the <a
  href="#anagram-match">Anagram Match</a> section.  Here are some examples of
  <i>Pattern Match</i> conditions:</p>

  <table width="100%">
  <tr><td><b>Pattern</b></td><td><b>Matches</b></td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>ATE</tt></td><td><tt>ATE</tt></td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>AT?</tt></td><td><tt>ATE, ATT</tt></td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>AT??</tt></td><td><tt>ATAP, ATES, ATMA, ATOM,
  ATOP</tt></td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>T?P</tt></td><td><tt>TAP, TIP, TOP, TUP</tt></td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>A[JQXZ]?</tt></td><td><tt>AXE, AZO</tt></td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>[AEIOU]D[AEIOU]</tt></td><td><tt>ADO, ODE, UDO</tt></td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>TO*P</tt></td><td><tt>TOP, TOECAP, TOSSUP, TOUCHUP, TOYSHOP,
  TOWNSHIP</tt></td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>*WM</tt></td><td><tt>CWM, SHAWM</tt></td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>?W*M?S</tt></td><td><tt>SWAMIS, SWAMPS, TWASOMES, TWOSOMES,
  TWELVEMOS</tt></td></tr>
  </table>

  <a name="subanagram-match">
  <h3>Subanagram Match</h3>

  <p>The <i>Subanagram Match</i> condition means that the letters in the
  search pattern can be matched in any order, and not all letters must be used
  in each matching word.  The same special wildcard characters can be used as
  described in the <a href="#pattern-match">Pattern Match</a> section.  Here
  are some examples of <i>Subanagram Match</i> conditions:</p>

  <table width="100%">
  <tr><td><b>Pattern</b></td><td><b>Matches</b></td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>ATE</tt></td><td><tt>AE, AT, ET, TA, ATE, EAT, ETA, TAE,
  TEA</tt></td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>LX?</tt></td><td><tt>AL, AX, EL, EX, LA, LI, LO, OX, XI, XU,
  LAX, LEX, LOX, LUX</tt></td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>LX[AU]</tt></td><td><tt>AL, AX, LA, XU, LAX, LUX</tt></td></tr>
  </table>

  <p>Note that with an <i>Subanagram Match</i> condition, using a <tt>*</tt>
  character will cause the pattern to match every acceptable word.</p>

  <a name="word-length">
  <h3>Word Length</h3>

  <p>A minimum and maximum length can be specified for the results of a
  search.  For example, if the minimum length is 4 and the maximum length is
  6, then the search will only return results that are between four and six
  letters long.  To specify minimum or maximum length, choose the
  <i>Length</i> condition and set the <i>Min</i> and <i>Max</i> values
  appropriately.  An exact length can also be specified by making the
  <i>Min</i> and <i>Max</i> values equal to each other.</p>

  <a name="prefixes-suffixes">
  <h3>Prefixes and Suffixes</h3>

  <p>There are two conditions for specifying that search results must take or
  not take certain prefixes or suffixes.</p>

  <p>The <i>Takes Prefix</i> condition specifies that every search result must
  also form a valid word when the specified prefix is added.  For example, if
  a <i>Takes Prefix</i> condition of <tt>PRE</tt> is specified in conjunction
  with a <i>Pattern Match</i> condition of <tt>VAL*</tt>, the word VALENCE
  will be found because PREVALENCE is also valid.  However, the word VALID
  will not be found because PREVALID* is not a valid word.</p>

  <p>If the <i>Not</i> checkbox is activated, the meaning of the <i>Takes
  Prefix</i> condition is exactly reversed.  In the previous example, the word
  VALID would appear in the search results because it does <i>not</i> take
  <tt>PRE</tt> as a prefix, and VALENCE would not appear, because it
  <i>does</i> take <tt>PRE</tt> as a prefix.</p>

  <p>The <i>Takes Suffix</i> condition specifies that every search result must
  also form a valid word when the specified suffix is added.  For example, if
  a <i>Takes Suffix</i> condition of <tt>S</tt> is specified in conjunction
  with a <i>Pattern Match</i> condition of <tt>*ING</tt>, the word MOLDING
  will be found because MOLDINGS is also valid.  However, the word KICKING
  will not be found because KICKINGS* is not a valid word.</p>

  <p>If the <i>Not</i> checkbox is activated, the meaning of the <i>Takes
  Suffix</i> condition is exactly reversed.  In the previous example, the word
  KICKING would appear in the search results because it does <i>not</i> take
  <tt>S</tt> as a suffix, and MOLDING would not appear, because it <i>does</i>
  take <tt>S</tt> as a suffix.</p>

  <a name="includes-letters">
  <h3>Includes Letters</h3>

  <p>The <i>Includes Letters</i> condition specifies letters that must be
  included in each word in the search results.  This is most useful if you
  want to specify a <i>Pattern Match</i> condition with wildcard characters,
  and want the wildcards to match certain letters in an unspecified order.</p>

  <p>For example, to find all 7- and 8-letter words beginning with
  <tt>OVER</tt> and containing the letters <tt>A</tt>, <tt>L</tt>, and
  <tt>T</tt> in any order, do the following.  Specify a <i>Pattern Match</i>
  condition of <tt>OVER*</tt>, a <i>Minimum Length</i> condition of 7, a
  <i>Maximum Length</i> condition of 8, and a <i>Includes Letters</i>
  condition of <tt>ALT</tt>.  This search will find the words
  <tt>OVERLATE</tt>, <tt>OVERSALT</tt>, and <tt>OVERTALK</tt>.</p>

  <p>If a letter appears multiple times in a <i>Includes Letters</i>
  condition, the letter must appear at least that many times in each word in
  the search results.</p>

  <p>If the <i>Not</i> checkbox is activated, then the <i>Includes Letters</i>
  condition specifies letters that must not be included in the search results.
  This is most useful for generating special word lists, such as the list of
  words containing the letter Q but not the letter U.  To find such words,
  specify a <i>Includes Letters</i> condition of <tt>Q</tt> and a negated
  <i>Includes Letters</i> condition of <tt>U</tt>.  This search will find all
  the words containing Q but not U.</p>

  <a name="consists-of">
  <h3>Consists of</h3>

  <p>The <i>Consists of</i> condition specifies letters that must occur with a
  certain frequency.  This is useful for generating special word lists, such
  as the list of words containing at least 70% vowels.  To find such words,
  specify a <i>Consists of</i> condition, putting <tt>70</tt> in the
  <i>Min</i> numeric area, <tt>100</tt> in the <i>Max</i> numeric area, and
  <tt>AEIOU</tt> in the input box.</p>

  <a name="belongs-to-group">
  <h3>Belongs to Group</h3>

  <p>The <i>Belongs to Group</i> condition specifies special sets that each
  word must belong to.  Currently there are a few sets provided:</p>

  <p><b>Hook words.</b> The <i>Hook Words</i> set consists of all words that
  can form another valid word by removing the first or last letter.  For
  example, <tt>SHILL</tt> is a hook word, because the word <tt>HILL</tt> can
  be formed by removing its first letter.</p>

  <p><b>Front hooks.</b> The <i>Front Hooks</i> set consists of all words that
  can form another valid word by removing the first letter.  For example,
  <tt>AGAZE</tt> is a front hook, because the word <tt>GAZE</tt> can be formed
  by removing its first letter.</p>

  <p><b>Back hooks.</b> The <i>Back Hooks</i> set consists of all words that
  can form another valid word by removing the last letter.  For example,
  <tt>VIGA</tt> is a back hook, because the word <tt>VIG</tt> can be formed by
  removing its last letter.</p>

  <p><b>Type I Sevens.</b> The <i>Type I Sevens</i> set consists of 7-letter
  words containing a 6-letter bingo stem in the top 100 stems.  For example,
  <tt>AIRIEST</tt> is a Type I Seven because it contains the bingo stem
  <tt>SATIRE</tt>, which is in the top 100 stems.</p>

  <p><b>Type II Sevens.</b> The <i>Type II Sevens</i> set consists of 7-letter
  words consisting entirely of the letters in
  <tt>AAADEEEEGIIILNNOORRSSTTU</tt>, but not belonging to the <i>Type I
  Sevens</i> set.  This distribution of letters represents each letter that
  appears at least three times in the total letter distribution of some
  popular word games, plus an extra S because the S can be such a valuable
  letter.  For example, <tt>ADAGIAL</tt> is a Type II Seven because its
  letters are entirely within the set of letters described above, but it is
  not a Type I Seven.</p>

  <p><b>Type III Sevens.</b> The <i>Type III Sevens</i> set consists of
  7-letter words that have at least a certain probability, but do not belong
  to either the <i>Type I Sevens</i> or <i>Type II Sevens</i> set.  For a word
  to be a Type III Seven, its probability must be greater than or equal to the
  probability of the word <tt>HUNTERS</tt>.  For example, <tt>ABALONE</tt> is
  a Type III Seven, because its probability is greater than <tt>HUNTERS</tt>,
  but it is not a Type I Seven nor a Type II Seven.</p>

  <p><b>Type I Eights.</b> The <i>Type I Eights</i> set consists of 8-letter
  words containing a 6-letter bingo stem in the top 100 stems.  For example,
  <tt>SEXTARII</tt> is a Type I Eight because it contains the bingo stem
  <tt>SATIRE</tt>, which is in the top 100 stems.</p>

  <p><b>Type II Eights.</b> The <i>Type II Eights</i> set consists of 8-letter
  words consisting entirely of the letters in
  <tt>AAADEEEEGIIILNNOORRSSTTU</tt>, but not belonging to the <i>Type I
  Eights</i> set.  This distribution of letters represents each letter that
  appears at least three times in the total letter distribution of some
  popular word games, plus an extra S because the S can be such a valuable
  letter.  For example, <tt>ADENOSES</tt> is a Type II Eight because its
  letters are entirely within the set of letters described above, but it is
  not a Type I Eight.</p>

  <p><b>Type III Eights.</b> The <i>Type III Eights</i> set consists of
  7-letter words that have at least a certain probability, but do not belong
  to either the <i>Type I Eights</i> or <i>Type II Eights</i> set.  For a word
  to be a Type III Eight, its probability must be greater than or equal to the
  probability of the word <tt>NOTIFIED</tt>.  For example, <tt>ABOIDEAU</tt>
  is a Type III Eight, because its probability is greater than
  <tt>NOTIFIED</tt>, but it is not a Type I Eight nor a Type II Eight.</p>

  <p><b>Eights From Seven-Letter Stems.</b> The <i>Eights From Seven-Letter
  Stems</i> set consists of 8-letter words containing a 7-letter bingo stem in
  the top 100 stems.  For example, <tt>AZOTISED</tt> is an Eight From
  Seven-Letter Stems because it contains the bingo stem <tt>TOADIES</tt>,
  which is in the top 100 stems.</p>

  <p><b>New in OWL2.</b> The <i>New in OWL2</i> set consists of words in the
  OWL2 lexicon that are not in the OWL lexicon.  For example, <tt>QI</tt>
  belongs to the New in OWL2 set because it is valid in OWL2 but not in
  OWL.</p>

  <a name="in-word-list">
  <h3>In Word List</h3>

  <p>The <i>In Word List</i> and <i>Must Not Be In Word List</i> condition
  specifies a list that each word must belong to.  Only words in the word list
  will appear in the search results.  If the <i>Not</i> checkbox is activated,
  only words <i>not</i> in the word list will appear in the search
  results.</p>

  <p>To create a word list, click the <i>Edit List</i> button.  A window will
  appear, allowing a word list to be read from a file.  To read a word list
  from a file, click the <i>Open File</i> button and select the file
  containing the word list.  A word list file is expected to have one word per
  line.  Words from more files can be included by clicking the <i>Open
  File</i> button multiple times.  The word list can be cleared by clicking
  the <i>Clear</i> button.</p>

  <p>When the word list is complete, click the <i>OK</i> button.  The search
  area will display the number of words in the list.</p>

  <a name="num-anagrams">
  <h3>Number of Anagrams</h3>

  <p>A minimum and maximum number of anagrams can be specified for the results
  of a search.  For example, if the minimum length is 2 and the maximum is 4,
  then the search will only return words that have between two and four
  anagrams.  A word is considered to be an anagram of itself, so every valid
  word has at least one anagram.</p>

  <p>To specify minimum or maximum number of anagrams, choose the <i>Number of
  Anagrams</i> condition and set the <i>Min</i> and <i>Max</i> values
  appropriately.  An exact length can also be specified by making the
  <i>Min</i> and <i>Max</i> values equal to each other.</p>

  <a name="probability-order">
  <h3>Probability Order</h3>

  <p>A <i>Probability Order</i> search condition can be used to limit the
  search results to a certain range of words in order of probability.  For
  example, to find the top 1000 7-letter words in order of probability, create
  a search with a <i>Length</i> condition of Min 7, Max 7, and a
  <i>Probability Order</i> condition of Min 1, Max 1000.</p>

  <p>The <i>Probability Order</i> condition is applied last, after all other
  search conditions.  So for example, in the search mentioned above, Zyzzyva
  first finds all 7-letter words.  Then it finds the words ranked 1-1000 out
  of that list.  This works as one would expect for a simple search like "all
  7-letter words".</p>

  <p>However, for a more complicated search like <i>Length</i> Min 7, Max 7;
  <i>Not In Word List</i> X; <i>Probability Order</i> Min 1, Max 5000, the
  behavior may be somewhat unexpected.  First, Zyzzyva finds all the 7-letter
  words that are not in word list X.  Then, it takes the top 5000 of those
  words.  The "1-5000" probability condition doesn't find 7s that are ranked
  1-5000 in overall probability.  Instead, Zyzzyva ranks the words that are
  found by the rest of the search conditions, then takes the top 5000 words of
  that set.</p>

  <p>This behavior is relatively unintuitive, and will probably change in the
  near future.</p>

  <a name="other-options">
  <h3>Other Options</h3>

  <p>If the <i>Use lower-case letters for wildcard matches</i> checkbox is
  activated, any letters matched by a question mark (<tt>?</tt>) or a
  character class in square brackets (e.g. <tt>[ABC]</tt>) will appear in
  lower case in the search results.  For example, with this checkbox
  activated, an <i>Anagram Match</i> search of <tt>EXT?</tt> will result in
  <tt>EXiT</tt>, <tt>nEXT</tt>, <tt>sEXT</tt>, <tt>TEXt</tt>, <tt>vEXT</tt>
  rather than <tt>EXIT</tt>, <tt>NEXT</tt>, <tt>SEXT</tt>, <tt>TEXT</tt>,
  <tt>VEXT</tt>.</p>

  <a name="load-save-search">
  <h2>Loading and Saving Searches</h2>

  <p>It can be inconvenient to create complicated searches from scratch each
  time, especially if the same search is used often.  For this reason, Zyzzyva
  allows you to save searches and load them again later.  Anywhere that you
  can create a search (for example, in the Search tab or the New Quiz window),
  there is a <i>Save Search</i> button.  After creating the desired search
  conditions, click the <i>Save Search</i> button to save them.  A window will
  appear to allow you to save the search to a file.</p>

  <p>Later, if you want to repeat the same search you saved, you can click the
  <i>Load Search</i> button.  A window will appear to allow you to select the
  saved search file.  After choosing the file, the saved search conditions
  will appear in the search specification area just as if they had been
  entered from scratch.</p>

  <p>When saving a search, only the search specification is saved.  The words
  found by the search are not saved.  This allows for flexibility in
  searching.  For example, if you save a search that finds 3-letter words,
  that search will correctly find all 3-letter words no matter what lexicon
  Zyzzyva is using.</p>
