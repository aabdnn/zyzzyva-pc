  <h1>Searching for Words</h1>

  <p>Choose <tt>File-&gt;New Search</tt> from the main menu to create a new
  Search tab.  A Search tab can be used to find all acceptable words that
  match certain conditions.  The conditions are specified in the top part of
  the Search tab, and the resulting list of words is displayed in the bottom
  area.  Initially only a single search condition is displayed.  Add more
  conditions by clicking the <i>More</i> button.  Remove conditions from the
  bottom of the list by clicking the <i>Fewer</i> button.  When the search
  conditions are correct, click the <i>Search</i> button to perform a
  search.</p>

  <a name="search-conditions">
  <h2>Search Conditions</h2>

  <p>The available search conditions are described below.  Any number of each
  type of condition can be specified in a single search.</p>

  <a name="pattern-match">
  <h3>Pattern Match</h3>

  <p>The <i>Pattern Match</i> condition means that the search pattern must be
  matched exactly, in the same order the letters are specified.  Special
  wildcard characters can be used to match any letters: the <tt>?</tt>
  character means "match any single letter" and the <tt>*</tt> character means
  "match any number of letters".  The <tt>*</tt> character also matches
  nothingness.  Multiple wildcard characters can be used in a single pattern.
  The <tt>[</tt> and <tt>]</tt> characters can also be used to specify a set
  of letters that can be matched.  Here are some examples of <i>Pattern
  Match</i> conditions:</p>

  <table width="100%">
  <tr><td><b>Pattern</b></td><td><b>Matches</b></td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>ATE</tt></td><td><tt>ATE</tt></td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>AT?</tt></td><td><tt>ATE, ATT</tt></td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>AT??</tt></td><td><tt>ATAP, ATES, ATMA, ATOM,
  ATOP</tt></td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>T?P</tt></td><td><tt>TAP, TIP, TOP, TUP</tt></td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>A[JQXZ]?</tt></td><td><tt>AXE, AZO</tt></td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>[AEIOU]D[AEIOU]</tt></td><td><tt>ADO, ODE, UDO</tt></td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>TO*P</tt></td><td><tt>TOP, TOECAP, TOSSUP, TOUCHUP, TOYSHOP,
  TOWNSHIP</tt></td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>*WM</tt></td><td><tt>CWM, SHAWM</tt></td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>?W*M?S</tt></td><td><tt>SWAMIS, SWAMPS, TWASOMES, TWOSOMES,
  TWELVEMOS</tt></td></tr>
  </table>

  <a name="anagram-match">
  <h3>Anagram Match</h3>

  <p>The <i>Anagram Match</i> condition means that the letters in the search
  pattern can be matched in any order.  All the letters must be matched
  exactly the number of times they appear in the match pattern.  The same
  special wildcard characters can be used as described in the <a
  href="#pattern-match">Pattern Match</a> section.  Here are some examples of
  <i>Anagram Match</i> conditions:</p>

  <table width="100%">
  <tr><td><b>Pattern</b></td><td><b>Matches</b></td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>ATE</tt></td><td><tt>ATE, EAT, ETA, TAE, TEA</tt></td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>AENORST</tt></td><td><tt>ATONERS, SENATOR,
  TREASON</tt></td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>ETX?</tt></td><td><tt>EXIT, NEXT, SEXT, TEXT,
  VEXT</tt></td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>PI??Z</tt></td><td><tt>PIZZA, PRIZE, SPITZ, UNZIP,
  ZIPPY</tt></td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>Z[AEIOU][AEIOU]</tt></td><td><tt>AZO, ZEE, ZOA,
  ZOO</tt></td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>*JBX</tt></td><td><tt>JAMBEAUX</tt></td></tr>
  </table>

  <p>Note that with an <i>Anagram Match</i> condition, using more than one
  <tt>*</tt> character has the same effect as using just one.</p>

  <a name="subanagram-match">
  <h3>Subanagram Match</h3>

  <p>The <i>Subanagram Match</i> condition means that the letters in the
  search pattern can be matched in any order, and not all letters must be used
  in each matching word.  The same special wildcard characters can be used as
  described in the <a href="#pattern-match">Pattern Match</a> section.  Here
  are some examples of <i>Subanagram Match</i> conditions:</p>

  <table width="100%">
  <tr><td><b>Pattern</b></td><td><b>Matches</b></td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>ATE</tt></td><td><tt>AE, AT, ET, TA, ATE, EAT, ETA, TAE,
  TEA</tt></td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>LX?</tt></td><td><tt>AL, AX, EL, EX, LA, LI, LO, OX, XI, XU,
  LAX, LEX, LOX, LUX</tt></td></tr>
  <tr><td><tt>LX[AU]</tt></td><td><tt>AL, AX, LA, XU, LAX, LUX</tt></td></tr>
  </table>

  <p>Note that with an <i>Subanagram Match</i> condition, using a <tt>*</tt>
  character will cause the pattern to match every acceptable word.</p>

  <a name="word-length">
  <h3>Word Length</h3>

  <p>A minimum and maximum length can be specified for the results of a
  search.  For example, if the minimum length is 4 and the maximum length is
  6, then the search will only return results that are between four and six
  letters long.  To specify minimum or maximum length, choose the <i>Minimum
  Length</i> or <i>Maximum Length</i> conditions, respectively.  An exact
  length can also be specified by choosing the <i>Exact Length</i>
  condition.</p>

  <a name="must-include">
  <h3>Must Include</h3>

  <p>The <i>Must Include</i> condition specifies letters that must
  be included in each word in the search results.  This is most useful if you
  want to specify a <i>Pattern Match</i> condition with wildcard characters,
  and want the wildcards to match certain letters in an unspecified order.</p>

  <p>For example, to find all 7- and 8-letter words beginning with
  <tt>OVER</tt> and containing the letters <tt>A</tt>, <tt>L</tt>, and
  <tt>T</tt> in any order, do the following.  Specify a <i>Pattern Match</i>
  condition of <tt>OVER*</tt>, a <i>Minimum Length</i> condition of 7, a
  <i>Maximum Length</i> condition of 8, and a <i>Must Include</i> condition of
  <tt>ALT</tt>.  This search will find the words <tt>OVERLATE</tt>,
  <tt>OVERSALT</tt>, and <tt>OVERTALK</tt>.</p>

  <p>If a letter appears multiple times in a <i>Must Include</i> condition,
  the letter must appear at least that many times in each word in the search
  results.</p>

  <a name="must-exclude">
  <h3>Must Exclude</h3>

  <p>The <i>Must Exclude</i> condition specifies letters that must not be
  included in the search results.  This is most useful for generating special
  word lists, such as the list of words containing the letter Q but not the
  letter U.  To find such words, specify a <i>Must Include</i> condition of
  <tt>Q</tt> and a <i>Must Exclude</i> condition of <tt>U</tt>.  This search
  will find all the words containing Q but not U.</p>

  <a name="must-consist">
  <h3>Must Consist Of</h3>

  <p>The <i>Must Consist Of</i> condition specifies letters that must occur
  with a certain minimum frequency.  This is useful for generating special
  word lists, such as the list of words containing at least 70% vowels.  To
  find such words, specify a <i>Must Consist Of</i> condition, putting
  <tt>70</tt> in the numeric area and <tt>AEIOU</tt> in the input box.</p>

  <a name="must-belong">
  <h3>Must Belong To</h3>

  <p>The <i>Must Belong To</i> condition specifies special sets that each word
  must belong to.  Currently there are a few sets provided:</p>

  <p><b>Hook words.</b> The <i>Hook Words</i> set consists of all words that
  can form another valid word by removing the first or last letter.  For
  example, <tt>SHILL</tt> is a hook word, because the word <tt>HILL</tt> can
  be formed by removing its first letter.</p>

  <p><b>Front hooks.</b> The <i>Front Hooks</i> set consists of all words that
  can form another valid word by removing the first letter.  For example,
  <tt>AGAZE</tt> is a front hook, because the word <tt>GAZE</tt> can be formed
  by removing its first letter.</p>

  <p><b>Back hooks.</b> The <i>Back Hooks</i> set consists of all words that
  can form another valid word by removing the last letter.  For example,
  <tt>VIGA</tt> is a back hook, because the word <tt>VIG</tt> can be formed by
  removing its last letter.</p>

  <p><b>Type I Sevens.</b> The <i>Type I Sevens</i> set consists of 7-letter
  words containing a 6-letter bingo stem in the top 100 stems.  For example,
  <tt>AIRIEST</tt> is a Type I Seven because it contains the bingo stem
  <tt>SATIRE</tt>, which is in the top 100 stems.</p>

  <p><b>Type I Eights.</b> The <i>Type I Eights</i> set consists of 8-letter
  words containing a 6-letter bingo stem in the top 100 stems.  For example,
  <tt>SEXTARII</tt> is a Type I Eight because it contains the bingo stem
  <tt>SATIRE</tt>, which is in the top 100 stems.</p>

  <a name="in-word-list">
  <h3>In Word List</h3>

  <p>The <i>In Word List</i> condition specifies a list that each word must
  belong to.  Only words in the word list will appear in the search
  results.</p>

  <p>To create a word list, click the <i>Edit List</i> button.  A window will
  appear, allowing a word list to be read from a file.  To read a word list
  from a file, click the <i>Open File</i> button and select the file
  containing the word list.  A word list file is expected to have one word per
  line.  Words from more files can be included by clicking the <i>Open
  File</i> button multiple times.  The word list can be cleared by clicking
  the <i>Clear</i> button.</p>

  <p>When the word list is complete, click the <i>OK</i> button.  The search
  area will display the number of words in the list.</p>

  <a name="num-anagrams">
  <h3>Number of Anagrams</h3>

  <p>A minimum and maximum number of anagrams can be specified for the results
  of a search.  For example, if the minimum length is 2 and the maximum is 4,
  then the search will only return words that have between two and four
  anagrams.  A word is considered to be an anagram of itself, so every valid
  word has at least one anagram.</p>

  <p>To specify a minimum or maximum number of anagrams, choose the <i>Minimum
  Anagrams</i> or <i>Maximum Anagrams</i> conditions, respectively.  An exact
  number of anagrams can also be specified with the <i>Exact Anagrams</i>
  condition.</p>

  <!--
  <a name="other-options">
  <h3>Other Options</h3>

  <p>If the <i>Use lower-case letters for wildcard matches</i> checkbox is
  activated, any letters matched by a wildcard character will appear in lower
  case in the search results.  For example, with this checkbox activated, an
  <i>Anagram</i> search of <tt>EXT?</tt> will result in <tt>EXiT</tt>,
  <tt>nEXT</tt>, <tt>sEXT</tt>, <tt>TEXt</tt>, <tt>vEXT</tt> rather than
  <tt>EXIT</tt>, <tt>NEXT</tt>, <tt>SEXT</tt>, <tt>TEXT</tt>,
  <tt>VEXT</tt>.</p>

  <h2>Loading and Saving Searches</h2>

  <p>It can be inconvenient to create complicated searches from scratch each
  time, especially if the same search is used often.  For this reason, Zyzzyva
  allows you to save searches and load them again later.  Anywhere that you
  can create a search (for example, in the Search tab or the New Quiz window),
  there is a <i>Save Search</i> button.  After creating the desired search
  conditions, click the <i>Save Search</i> button to save them.  A window will
  appear to allow you to save the search to a file.</p>

  <p>Later, if you want to repeat the same search you saved, you can click the
  <i>Load Search</i> button.  A window will appear to allow you to select the
  saved search file.  After choosing the file, the saved search conditions
  will appear in the search specification area just as if they had been
  entered from scratch.</p>

  <p>When saving a search, only the search specification is saved.  The words
  found by the search are not saved.  This allows for flexibility in
  searching.  For example, if you save a search that finds 3-letter words,
  that search will correctly find all 3-letter words no matter what word list
  Zyzzyva is using.</p>
