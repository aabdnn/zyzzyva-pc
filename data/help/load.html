  <h1>Loading a Lexicon</h1>

  <p>In order for Zyzzyva to function properly, it must have a lexicon
  loaded.  Load a lexicon by choosing the <tt>File</tt> menu item, then
  <tt>Open</tt>.  Choose the lexicon file using the file browser that
  appears.</p>

  <p>The lexicon file should contain a list of valid words, one per line.
  Each word can also be followed by a definition, separated from the word by
  one or more spaces.  Here is an example of what a lexicon file might look
  like:</p>

  <pre>
AA rough, cindery lava
AB abdominal muscle
AD advertisement
  </pre>

  <p>Instead of loading a lexicon manually each time you use Zyzzyva, you can
  configure Zyzzyva to load a lexicon automatically each time it starts.  See
  <a href="preferences.html#auto-import">Lexicon Preferences</a> for more
  details.</p>
