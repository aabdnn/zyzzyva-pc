  <h1>Judging Words</h1>

  <p>Choose <tt>File-&gt;New Word Judge</tt> from the main menu to
  create a new Judge tab.
  A Judge tab can be used to determine whether a play consisting of one
  or more words is acceptable.  Judging words can be useful if you only want
  to know whether all of a set of certain words are acceptable, and don't want
  to know their definitions.  For example, in the middle of playing a word
  game, knowing a word's definition may change the way the word is treated by
  the players.  A player who might not otherwise have tried to add an S to the
  end of a word may feel comfortable doing so after learning that the word is
  a noun or verb.  Also, knowing whether any particular word is acceptable may
  not be desired if multiple words are being judged.  In the middle of a game,
  it is desirable to judge an entire play as acceptable or unacceptable
  without specifying which word or words are unacceptable.</p>

  <p>To Judge a set of words, go to the Judge tab.  Type the words to be
  judged into the input area.  Words can be separated by spaces or put on
  separate lines.  As long as the words are separated by some space, each word
  will be correctly identified.  After entering all the words to be judged,
  click the Judge button.  The words will be displayed, along with the word
  "Acceptable" or "Unacceptable".</p>
