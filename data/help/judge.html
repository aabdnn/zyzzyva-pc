  <h1>Judging Words</h1>

  <p>Choose <tt>File-&gt;Word Judge</tt> from the main menu to create a new
  Word Judge tab.  A Word Judge tab can be used to determine whether a play
  consisting of one or more words is acceptable.  Judging words can be useful
  if you only want to know whether all of a set of certain words are
  acceptable, and don't want to know their definitions.  For example, in the
  middle of playing a word game, knowing a word's definition may change the
  way the word is treated by the players.  A player who might not otherwise
  have tried to add an S to the end of a word may feel comfortable doing so
  after learning that the word is a noun or verb.  Also, knowing whether any
  particular word is acceptable may not be desired if multiple words are being
  judged simultaneously.  In the middle of a game, it is desirable to judge an
  entire play as acceptable or unacceptable without specifying which word or
  words are unacceptable.</p>

  <p>To judge a set of words, go to the Word Judge tab.  Type the words to be
  judged into the input area.  Words can be separated by spaces or put on
  separate lines.  As long as the words are separated by some space, each word
  will be correctly identified.  After entering all the words to be judged,
  click the <i>Judge</i> button.  The words will be displayed, along with the
  judgment "Acceptable" or "Unacceptable".</p>

  <h2>Full Screen Word Judge</h2>

  <p>Full Screen Word Judge is a mode that is useful for word adjudication in
  a public setting.  By clicking the <i>Full Screen</i> button on the Word
  Judge tab, a full-screen window will appear where words can be typed.  The
  font is much larger than the regular Word Judge area, and words can be
  judged by pressing the Tab key instead of clicking a button.  After clicking
  the Tab button to judge a set of words, the judgment is displayed with a
  large font and bright color: blue if the play is acceptable, or red if the
  play is unacceptable.  The screen will automatically return to the input
  area after 10 seconds if left alone, or any key press will have the same
  effect.</p>

  <p>If you would like the full screen Word Judge to create log files of its
  adjudications, please see the section about the
  <a href="preferences.html#judge-log-files">Word Judge Log Files</a>
  preference setting.</p>
