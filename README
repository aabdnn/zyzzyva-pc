Zyzzyva is free software, released under the GNU General Public License.
Please see COPYING and LICENSE for details.

To build Zyzzyva, you will need the Qt library, available from
http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt/index.html.  You will also the CMake
Makefile generator, available from http://cmake.org/HTML/Download.html.

After Qt and CMake are installed, the following steps should be sufficient to
build on Linux or other Unix platforms:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make

On Windows, the steps may be a little more complicated, including passing the
-G option to cmake (e.g. -G"Borland Makefiles"), and/or running CMakeSetup.exe
to help cmake find the Qt library.  See the CMake documentation for more
details: http://cmake.org/HTML/RunningCMake.html.

The Zyzzyva home page is http://zyzzyva.net/, and the latest version can
always be found there.  Please email Michael W Thelen <mike@pietdepsi.com>
with questions, comments, patches, or large cash donations.  Happy hacking!
